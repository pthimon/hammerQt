HammerQt Synthetic Environment
Copyright Simon Butler (2010)

This is the simulator for my PhD thesis. For more details see
http://simon-butler.com/Thesis.

You will need to install Delta3D (http://www.delta3d.org) and all of its
dependencies. You also need the clustering library that is available from
http://simon-butler.com/Thesis.

Tested using Delta3D version 2.2.0 and OpenSUSE 12.1

Additional dependencies are:
libgsl
libagg
libqwt5

See hammerQt.pro for the full list of dependencies. Edit custom.pri to 
specify where your Delta3D installation is.

To compile, first copy the data files from 
http://simon-butler.com/hammerQt-data.tar.gz to the hammerQt directory, then run:
qmake
make

To run:
./hammerQt --gui

For more details of the program operation run
